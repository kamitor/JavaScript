# JavaScript

This is a javascript code libary on building objects with learners.

Its objectives are as follows:

- Learn about the difference between object and a function
- Learn about the creation of objects (also called a constructor)
- Learn about creating a set objects trough an intterated function.
- Learn how to put objects in an array
- Learn how to address objects in that array


Teaching Plan:

Objectives:
- 40 % entertain, it has to be fun
- 35 % empower, they have to do it
- 25 % educate, they have to have "eurika moment"

entertain
Creating several objects of their own choosing that can be fun...?
Make a mini-game out of it? like Pong?
Like a shooting game? - Lets make a shooting game.

empower
Choosing their own object to be created.
Options will be; Ellipse, Rect, Line?
What object will be chosen.
where it will be chosen from

educate
The objective of the lesson is to understand that creating objects is easy, and helps organize your code.
It will be easier to add all your logic into one function (object)

Secondary objective is to learn how to build code

What do we need for a shooting game?


We need an object to shoot
  This object has a starting place
  This object has a velocity
  This only moves when a condition is met (spacebar is pressed)
  This object's angle is changed with keys
We need collission ditection?
  Something to hit
We need a way to win (keep score?)
  Display text with the screen to keep score
We need something to shoot from (like a cannon)

Let us build several stages:

Stage 1:
Functional program
Stage 2:
Lots of objects in an array
Stage 3:
Add objects by clicking
Push them into the array
Stage 4:
Let Objects be directed by the mouse (add velocity)
Stage 5:
Add score or object collission
